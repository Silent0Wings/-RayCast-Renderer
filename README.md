# -RayCast-Renderer
RayCast Renderer generates 2D images from 3D scenes by casting rays to detect intersections with object surfaces. Each triangle has assigned properties, like colors, which are used to create the final image. It focuses on direct rendering without simulating light bounces, ensuring efficiency and clarity.
